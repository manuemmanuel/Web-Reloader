# WebReloader
This Python script automates the process of reloading a given URL multiple times with a specified delay between each reload. It utilizes the requests library to make HTTP requests and time module to introduce delays.
## Prerequisites
Before running the script, ensure you have Python installed on your system. If not, you can download and install it from the official Python website.
Additionally, make sure to have the `requests` library installed. You can install it via pip: `pip install requests`
## Error Handling
The script incorporates error handling to handle situations where the URL is inaccessible or encounters other issues. If an error occurs during the reloading process, it will be caught and displayed in the console, providing you with relevant information about the nature of the error.
